# reachduck ðŸ¦†

Front-end helper functions for your DApp. Currently supports Ethereum (limited) and Algorand.\
Can optionally be paired with (unaffiliated) [reach `stdlib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reach-sh/stdlib) for more functionality.

A [changelog](https://github.com/JACK-COM/reachduck/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) was introduced in `0.4.3`, and *should* better cover any interesting or disruptive changes made to the library.

### You *may* need `@reach-sh/stdlib` for some things
> If you want to use features like user session management (connecting a wallet), you will need to separately [install `@reach-sh/stdlib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reach-sh/stdlib) in your project, and provide it to this package when necessary. `@jackcom/reachduck@^0.4.5` allows you to instantiate and use multiple `stdlib` instances.
