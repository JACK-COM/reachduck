# reachduck 🦆

Front-end helper functions for your DApp.\
Can optionally be paired with (unaffiliated) [reach `stdlib`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reach-sh/stdlib) for more functionality (see below).

## CAVEAT EMPTOR
### 1. This library is *extremely* in Alpha-status. 
It was hacked together as a convenience, and the documentation is a courtesy. Proceed only if you know exactly what you are doing. 

### 2. You *may* need `@reach-sh/stdlib`
This package works without reach. If you need the latter, you will need to separately [install it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@reach-sh/stdlib) in your project, and provide it to this package when necessary, and as described below. 

### 3. The most exemplary efforts have been put forth. 
Regardless, *expect* errors. And silence (or delayed responses), when you report them.
